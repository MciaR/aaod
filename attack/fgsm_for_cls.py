# Model Under Attack
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# 
# As mentioned, the model under attack is the same MNIST model from
# `pytorch/examples/mnist <https://github.com/pytorch/examples/tree/master/mnist>`__.
# You may train and save your own MNIST model or you can download and use
# the provided model. The *Net* definition and test dataloader here have
# been copied from the MNIST example. The purpose of this section is to
# define the model and dataloader, then initialize the model and load the
# pretrained weights.
# 

# LeNet Model
from model.lenet import LeNet

# MNIST Test dataset and dataloader declaration
test_loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(datasets.MNIST('data', train=False, download=True,transform=transforms.ToTensor()),batch_size=1, shuffle=True)

# Define what device we are using
print("CUDA Available: ", torch.cuda.is_available())
device = torch.device("cuda" if (use_cuda and torch.cuda.is_available()) else "cpu")

# Initialize the network
model = LeNet().to(device)

# Load the pretrained model
model.load_state_dict(torch.load(pretrained_model, map_location='cpu'))

# Set the model in evaluation mode. In this case this is for the Dropout layers
model.eval()

# FGSM Attack
# ~~~~~~~~~~~
# 
# Now, we can define the function that creates the adversarial examples by
# perturbing the original inputs. The ``fgsm_attack`` function takes three
# inputs, *image* is the original clean image (:math:`x`), *epsilon* is
# the pixel-wise perturbation amount (:math:`\epsilon`), and *data_grad*
# is gradient of the loss w.r.t the input image
# (:math:`\nabla_{x} J(\mathbf{\theta}, \mathbf{x}, y)`). The function
# then creates perturbed image as
# 
# .. math:: perturbed\_image = image + epsilon*sign(data\_grad) = x + \epsilon * sign(\nabla_{x} J(\mathbf{\theta}, \mathbf{x}, y))
# 
# Finally, in order to maintain the original range of the data, the
# perturbed image is clipped to range :math:`[0,1]`.
# 

# FGSM attack funciton

    # Collect the element-wise sign of the data gradient
    sign_data_grad = data_grad.sign()

    perturbed_image  = image + epsilon*sign_data_grad

    perturbed_image = torch.clamp(perturbed_image, 0, 1)

# Testing Function
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# 
# Finally, the central result of this tutorial comes from the ``test``
# function. Each call to this test function performs a full test step on
# the MNIST test set and reports a final accuracy. However, notice that
# this function also takes an *epsilon* input. This is because the
# ``test`` function reports the accuracy of a model that is under attack
# from an adversary with strength :math:`\epsilon`. More specifically, for
# each sample in the test set, the function computes the gradient of the
# loss w.r.t the input data (:math:`data\_grad`), creates a perturbed
# image with ``fgsm_attack`` (:math:`perturbed\_data`), then checks to see
# if the perturbed example is adversarial. In addition to testing the
# accuracy of the model, the function also saves and returns some
# successful adversarial examples to be visualized later.
#

# Run Attack
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# 
# The last part of the implementation is to actually run the attack. Here,
# we run a full test step for each epsilon value in the *epsilons* input.
# For each epsilon we also save the final accuracy and some successful
# adversarial examples to be plotted in the coming sections. Notice how
# the printed accuracies decrease as the epsilon value increases. Also,
# note the :math:`\epsilon=0` case represents the original test accuracy,
# with no attack.

# Results
# -------
# 
# Accuracy vs Epsilon
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# 
# The first result is the accuracy versus epsilon plot. As alluded to
# earlier, as epsilon increases we expect the test accuracy to decrease.
# This is because larger epsilons mean we take a larger step in the
# direction that will maximize the loss. Notice the trend in the curve is
# not linear even though the epsilon values are linearly spaced. For
# example, the accuracy at :math:`\epsilon=0.05` is only about 4% lower
# than :math:`\epsilon=0`, but the accuracy at :math:`\epsilon=0.2` is 25%
# lower than :math:`\epsilon=0.15`. Also, notice the accuracy of the model
# hits random accuracy for a 10-class classifier between
# :math:`\epsilon=0.25` and :math:`\epsilon=0.3`.

# Sample Adversarial Examples
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# 
# Remember the idea of no free lunch? In this case, as epsilon increases
# the test accuracy decreases **BUT** the perturbations become more easily
# perceptible. In reality, there is a tradeoff between accuracy
# degradation and perceptibility that an attacker must consider. Here, we
# show some examples of successful adversarial examples at each epsilon
# value. Each row of the plot shows a different epsilon value. The first
# row is the :math:`\epsilon=0` examples which represent the original
# “clean” images with no perturbation. The title of each image shows the
# “original classification -> adversarial classification.” Notice, the
# perturbations start to become evident at :math:`\epsilon=0.15` and are
# quite evident at :math:`\epsilon=0.3`. However, in all cases humans are
# still capable of identifying the correct class despite the added noise.

# Where to go next?
# -----------------
# 
# Hopefully this tutorial gives some insight into the topic of adversarial
# machine learning. There are many potential directions to go from here.
# This attack represents the very beginning of adversarial attack research
# and since there have been many subsequent ideas for how to attack and
# defend ML models from an adversary. In fact, at NIPS 2017 there was an
# adversarial attack and defense competition and many of the methods used
# in the competition are described in this paper: `Adversarial Attacks and
# Defences Competition <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.00097.pdf>`__. The work
# on defense also leads into the idea of making machine learning models
# more *robust* in general, to both naturally perturbed and adversarially
# crafted inputs.
# 
# Another direction to go is adversarial attacks and defense in different
# domains. Adversarial research is not limited to the image domain, check
# out `this <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.01944.pdf>`__ attack on
# speech-to-text models. But perhaps the best way to learn more about
# adversarial machine learning is to get your hands dirty. Try to
# implement a different attack from the NIPS 2017 competition, and see how
# it differs from FGSM. Then, try to defend the model from your own
# attacks.
